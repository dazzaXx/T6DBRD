# T6BRD
A USB Security Dongle Emulator for Tekken 6 Bloodline Rebellion for the Namco System 357/369 systems.

For use with Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero 2. I personally have used it with a Pi Zero 2 W, so I assume other models of Zero work too.

Run these commands too beforehand.
```
sudo mkdir /T6BRD
cd /T6BRD

Place script in newly created folder.

sudo chmod +x T6BRD.sh
sudo ./T6BRD.sh
```

The script is an all-in-one, just run it and done.
